# Bluemold Template Engine

Bluemold is a Javascript template lanuage conforming to a subset of the jQuery Template language.

It is designed to run on the server and output HTML or any text based format.

jQuery Template is DOM based while Bluemold is text based and behaves more like ERB, Moustache or many other template engines.
